## About the project

First of all I'm in engineering school (CESI) in apprenticeship and I proposed to my school to create a workshop aiming at helping
futur interested students in my education (Embedded Systems). This workshop could be usefull to :
* Show real work (what we are doing at work)
* Show real tools (like MPLABX, PSIM, Linux, ...)
* Show real electronic schemas
* And more

They have accepted my proposition and a part of this project is to create a model with an
arduino (mega) and some devices (PIR captor, LCD 16x2, Push buttons, and more).
I wish they could code and wire and solder with this project.
