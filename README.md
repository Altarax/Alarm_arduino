## About the project

First of all I'm in engineering school (CESI) in apprenticeship and I proposed to my school to create a workshop aiming at helping
futur interested students in my education (Embedded Systems). This workshop could be useful to :
* Show real work (what we are doing at work)
* Show real tools (like MPLABX, PSIM, Linux, ...)
* Show real electronic schemas
* And more

They have accepted my proposition and a part of this project is to create a model with an
arduino (mega) and some devices (PIR captor, LCD 16x2, Push buttons, and more).
I wish they could code and wire and solder with this project.

### Built with 
* [Arduino MEGA]
* [PIR Captor]
* [C Langage]
* [8 Push Buttons]
* [Potar]
* [Breadboard]
* [Electrical resistance]
* [Buzzer + 12V Battery + Transistor]

## First steps

I recently discovered an incredible website "wokwi.com".
It allows us to create simulation with Arduino and about thirty devices and test your code before IRL implementation.
Besides, you can find the project simulation on this link : https://wokwi.com/arduino/projects/314902860732039745

Just FYI, here is what it looks like on the website :

## Roadmap

- [ ] Add alarm for the fake password
- [x] Add feature to write * on the LCD when a button is pressed
- [ ] Add alarm sound
